Hello there, my name is Alex. For nearly 10 years (damn!) I've been studying mathematics in Russia and Germany and now I am working as a software engineer in the UK. In this blog, I share my experience in different areas of mathematics and programming, many of which I, personally, used to find rather tedious or overly complicated. That is, until I stumbled upon them in practical applications and understood their essence and value.

My goal is to help you have the same *a-ha* moment by exploring bite-size topics from computational geometry, signal processing, mathematical physics and whatever else area I may find particularly cool. Occasionally, a rogue post about software development or soft skills may appear. I hope you'll learn something new for yourself or at least find my presentation less dry than the material commonly offered in textbooks. Cheers!
